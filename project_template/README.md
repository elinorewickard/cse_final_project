# Wall of Fire 
A game where the player avoids the impending death of fire following behind him as well as all objects except for berry bushes
which are trying to also end his life. Your score is dependant on how many berries you can eat and your total distance.

## Getting Started
---
To run the game, simply run the program called __main__.py
Controls are A, D, and space to go left, right, and jump, and W and S are for moving up and down the layers.
Collect berries to score and stay in front of the fire to survive.
